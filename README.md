Hello!  
This is my Code Louisville React.js Final Project for the May 2019 session.  

About this project:
-The three API Calls are made using 'fetch()' so this project is not compatible with Internet Explorer. 
-The three routed links listed in the Navbar each demonstrate a successful Fetch APi to a freely available API.  
They are set to catch any errors in the console, so if there seems to be a problem or delay, please check the console for details.  
- Be advised, The Flickr Image Search utilizes a keyword input, and it is possible that the images returned by Flickr are NSFW.
- there is a section of code in the quoteoftheDay component that is copied and pasted from the provider of the API.  Their documentation included a request that their logo be included in it's use, but I ran into styling issues as they are handled by through React.js.  The code has been commented out, but I left it so I could look into it after the final project is due.

Initially, I had some issues calling API's that were getting blocked via Cross Origin Resource Sharing and Cross Origin Read Blocking , which created issues with my initial idea for the project; a City of Louisville Restaurant health Score checker.  So I pivoted to a less complimentary set of API's that were more welcoming to a newer developer.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
